Source of data - Data with respect to Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Fidelity Investments, which obtains certain data from the funds' prospectuses and annual or semi-annual reports. Data with
respect to non-Fidelity mutual funds is obtained from Morningstar, Inc., which is not affiliated with Fidelity Investments. Accuracy, completeness and timeliness of Morningstar data cannot be guaranteed.
Non-mutual fund investment option data is requested from the Investment option's issuer or other service provider. In the event that any information with respect to an investment option was not received
and is not shown in the chart above, please contact the issuer or other service provider for the investment option directly to obtain such information.
1Assets - Assets used in this calculation represent plan balances as of the close of business on the date noted in the Asset column header and do not reflect subsequent adjustments that might have had
a retroactive effect on such balances.
2Category - Fidelity Investments provides the investment-related category for its funds. The investment-related category for other investment options is provided by Morningstar Inc. or in some cases by
the investment option manager.
3Investment Option Fees Attributable to Recordkeeping - Generally, these amounts are used to support services described in the Administrative and Recordkeeping Services and Compensation section
and set forth in more detail in your trust or service agreement; depending on your plan's fee arrangement, these amounts may offset fees listed in that section. With respect to Fidelity funds, this column
(%) shows the rate that would be used to calculate payments to a nonaffiliated recordkeeper to support certain services for Fidelity funds. In the case of Fidelity funds that are offered only to Fidelity
recordkept plans (other than multi-manager funds), the rate is based on the payments Fidelity receives from comparable funds. In the case of Fidelity multi-manager funds (which may hold Fidelity and
nonproprietary funds), the rate is based on the rate that would be used to calculate payments to a nonaffiliated recordkeeper for a Fidelity fund of a similar asset class that does not hold nonproprietary
funds although any payments that may be received in connection with any nonproprietary funds held by the fund range from 0 to 40 bps. With respect to nonproprietary funds, this column (%) shows the
rate that is used to calculate payments Fidelity receives pursuant to a contract or other arrangement between Fidelity and the fund, fund provider, or contract issuer under which Fidelity provides certain
services to such fund, fund provider, or contract issuer. These payments are used to support Fidelity's services to the plan and are considered indirect compensation under the 408(b)(2) regulation. The
dollar amounts shown are calculated by multiplying the percentage by the amount in the corresponding Assets column. Neither the rates nor the calculated dollar amounts represent a separate charge.
If your plan contains investment options that are comprised of more than one component fund, a blended payment rate (%) will be calculated based on only the component funds that currently provide
payments to support recordkeeping services. All other component funds that comprise the investment option, such as those that do not provide such payments, will not be listed.
4Investment Option Fees Attributable to Management and Other - This column reflects the difference (in percentage and dollar terms, respectively) between the Total Investment Option Fees column and
the Investment Option Fees Attributable to Recordkeeping column. It does not represent a separate charge in the expense ratio of the investment option.
5Total Investment Option Fees - This column reflects the net expense ratio for the investment option as calculated by the investment option issuer or other service provider and obtained from the source(s)
described above. In general, the net expense ratio for a mutual fund is its investment management and operating expenses calculated with any applicable waivers, caps, and/or reimbursements deducted.
Waivers, caps, and/or reimbursements may be voluntary and terminated at any time unless otherwise disclosed in the applicable fund's prospectus. The fees and expenses for non-mutual fund investment
options may be calculated using methodologies different from those used for mutual funds and may include trustee and/or other administrative fees that the plan sponsor has directed be accrued and paid
from the option but may not include all the fees that mutual fund expense ratios are required to reflect. The expense ratio or similar expense amount may not take into consideration every expense
associated with an investment option. For example, portfolio trading costs may not be reflected in an investment option's expense ratio, but do figure into its overall return. The dollar amounts shown are
calculated by multiplying the percentage by the amount in the corresponding Assets column.
Please note the regulation under ERISA section 408(b)(2) requires that the plan's recordkeeper provide certain investment disclosures including the annual operating expenses (e.g., expense ratio) of
certain investment options for which the recordkeeper provides services to the extent that information is within the control of or reasonably available to the recordkeeper. The expense ratio required to
meet this obligation must be calculated in accordance with the Department of Labor's regulation under ERISA section 404(a) and is commonly referred to as the investment option's "gross expense ratio."
Please see the Services and Compensation Reported Separately section for details regarding where gross expense ratios and other investment disclosures may be accessed.
6Short-term Trading Fee - Fee charged by an investment option to investors who hold their shares for less than a predetermined period of time (such as 90 days or 120 days). This fee (e.g., 0.75%, 1.5%,
etc.) varies and is paid to the investment option.Client Name: WINBOND ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AMERICA	Plan Name:	WINBOND ELECTRONICS CORPORATION AMERICA 401(K) PLAN				Investment Option

			7Annuity - A contract issued by an insurance company to the plan sponsor or plan trustee. Both Fixed and Variable annuities may be available with a variety of structures to deliver various features or
benefits like a guaranteed rate of return or a guaranteed amount of income at retirement age.
8Surrender Charge - The insurance company levies surrender charges when an investor withdraws money in excess of the acceptable amount before the specified date. Usually, the surrender charge is
expressed as a percentage of the amount of the money that is either withdrawn or surrendered.
9Insurance Fee - The percentage of subaccount assets deducted each year to cover Mortality and Expense (M&E) Fee, risk charges, and other miscellaneous administration fees.
Fund of funds - A mutual fund or strategy fund that invests all or almost all its assets in other funds (called a "fund of funds") is required to calculate its gross expense ratio by adding the weighted net
expense ratios of its underlying funds to the gross expense ratio of the "top fund," and to calculate its net expense ratio by adding the weighted net expense ratio of its underlying funds to the net expense
ratio of its "top fund." The expense ratios of the underlying funds are aggregated and pro-rated in a manner that reflects their average weight among the holdings of the "top fund." In cases where the "top
fund" charges no additional expenses, the gross and net expense ratios will be identical.
If Fidelity Management Trust Company (FMTC) or Fidelity Institutional Asset Management Trust Company (FIAM TC) is the investment manager of an investment option listed above, it serves in a
fiduciary capacity under ERISA. For more information regarding such services, please consult the trust or investment management documents. Certain contributions to, and redemptions from, the FMTC
and FIAM TC commingled pools may be subject to a fee pursuant to significant cash flow policies. The fees vary by pool, and are payable to the commingled pool and intended to cover the costs of
investing in or selling securities in the pool.
Fidelity may receive a payment from American Fund Distributors (AFD) for among other things, to compensate Fidelity for providing them access to financial intermediaries and investors in certain Fidelity
channels, a platform to support the provision of investment guidance and service to such financial intermediaries and investors, when applicable, and to promote operational efficiencies. As described in
American Fund prospectuses, AFD has discretion as to the amount of the payment, if any; the criteria to determine any payment includes sales, assets, and cash flows as well as qualitative factors. It is
anticipated that the payment would not exceed .08% annually of American Fund assets in all retail, workplace and intermediary channels maintained by Fidelity, subject to certain exclusions.
Fidelity may receive an annual product fee of up to $2,000 if aggregate assets held in that product across all retail, workplace and intermediary channels maintained by Fidelity are less than $1.5 million.
Fidelity may receive a fee from unaffiliated product providers to compensate Fidelity for maintaining the infrastructure to accommodate unaffiliated products. The fee is a fixed amount that typically
equates to less than 0.05% of a product provider's assets in all retail, workplace, and intermediary channels maintained by Fidelity and does not vary based on a plan's offering of an unaffiliated product
supported by Fidelity. In addition, such unaffiliated product providers may pay Fidelity initial start-up fees, product add, and maintenance fees as well as a provider minimum monthly fees. These fees are
not in connection with Fidelity's services to the plan and are not considered indirect compensation under the 408(b)(2) regulations.
Additional Disclosure:
Good Faith Estimate of the Cost of Recordkeeping - The regulation under ERISA section 408(b)(2) provides a special rule if the plan recordkeeper does not charge an explicit recordkeeping fee or its
compensation is offset by other amounts received by the recordkeeper or an affiliate. In such cases, the regulation requires a "good faith estimate" of the cost of such services to the plan. Accordingly, the
good faith estimate for your plan can be determined by adding the Investment Option Fees Attributable to Recordkeeping column total to any billable recordkeeping fees and reducing that by any credits
granted under your contract.
The following fees may apply if your plan offers company stock as an investment option.
Stock fund commissions:
Real-time traded - No more than $0.029 per share
Share Accounted - $0.034 to $0.05 per share
Unitized - No more than $0.02 per share
Based on plan fiduciary direction, brokerage services may be provided by non-Fidelity entities, in which case Fidelity is not receiving listed compensation and commissions may vary. If special trading
requested, commissions may vary.Administrative and Recordkeeping Services and Compensation

initiated transactions. If these fees are paid by the plan, such payments would be considered "direct compensation" under the 408(b)(2) regulation. In most instances, the amounts
listed in the Investment Option Fees Attributable to Recordkeeping column in the Investment Option-Related Services and Compensation section are in addition to the fees listed
