A This column details the name (and share class if applicable) of each investment fund that you have indicated you wish to designate for your Plan and the
location on the Plan Resource Center where its prospectus or Declaration of Trust can be accessed. A prospectus or Declaration of Trust may not be available
for any “frozen” investment funds that have been accommodated by ADP in connection with your Plan’s conversion to ADP.
B Based upon assets in your current plan investment options, the assets (as of the date indicated, minus any loans) that would map to the investment funds you
have indicated you wish to designate. Asset information is provided by you or taken from ADP’s records. It is included in this chart as a convenience only and
is not part of the disclosure required by law. Assets in each fund will change over time. Once ADP assumes responsibility for recordkeeping plan transactions,
actual plan and fund assets as of any given date may be found on the Plan Resource Center.
C A total expense ratio (net) is a fund’s annual operating expenses expressed as a percentage of average net assets and includes management fees,
administrative fees, and any marketing and distribution fees. Expense ratios directly reduce returns to investors. The expense ratio typically includes the
following types of fees: accounting, administrator, advisor, auditor, board of directors, custodial, distribution (12b-1), legal organizational, professional,
registration, shareholder reporting, sub-advisor, and transfer agency. The expense ratio does not reflect the fund’s brokerage costs or any investor sales
charges. For publicly traded mutual funds, the net prospectus expense ratio is collected from the fund’s most recent prospectus and provided by Morningstar.
This is the percentage of fund assets paid for operating expenses and management fees. Collective Trust Fund expense ratios are provided by the investment
manager. ADP takes the expense ratios for mutual funds from a monthly Morningstar data feed and updates its systems with this information by the 6th
business day of each month. If a mutual fund’s prospectus is updated between data updates, any change to the expense ratio may not be reflected in this
chart. To confirm an expense ratio has not changed in the interim, look at the mutual fund’s prospectus. The introduction to this chart explains how to access a
fund’s disclosure materials on the ADP Plan Resource Center. To calculate a fund’s net expense ratio for a one-year period expressed as a dollar amount for
a $1,000 investment, multiply the net expense ratio shown times $1,000. (For example, a net expense ratio of 0.75% X $1,000 equals $7.50 per $1,000.00.)
D In contrast to the net expense ratio, the gross expense ratio does not reflect any fee waivers in effect during the time period. Morningstar pulls the prospectus
gross expense ratio from the fund’s most recent prospectus. Collective Trust Fund expense ratios are provided by the investment managers. ADP takes the
expense ratios for mutual funds from a monthly Morningstar data feed and updates its systems with this information by the 6th business day of each month. If
a mutual fund’s prospectus is updated between data updates, any change to the expense ratio may not be reflected in this chart. To confirm an expense ratio
has not changed in the interim, look at the mutual fund’s prospectus. The introduction to this chart explains how to access a fund’s disclosure materials on the
ADP Plan Resource Center. To calculate a fund’s gross expense ratio for a one-year period expressed as a dollar amount for a $1,000 investment, multiply
the gross expense ratio shown times $1,000. (For example, a gross expense ratio of 0.75% X $1,000 equals $7.50 per $1,000.00.)
E 12b-1 fees are generally received for providing one or more of the following services to or on behalf of investment funds or their affiliates: distribution services
(including marketing), communication services, and shareholder servicing (includes: furnishing personal and other services and assistance, answering routine
inquiries regarding a fund, assisting in changing dividend options, account designations and addresses, assistance with changing shareholder account
designations and maintaining such recordkeeping accounts or such other services as the fund may require).
F Sub-Transfer Agent/Shareholder Servicing Fees are generally received for providing one or more of the following services to or on behalf of investment funds
or their affiliates: sub-accounting and administrative services (including, among others: order processing, recordkeeping, communications and
shareholder/participant servicing).
G Common Collective Trust Service Payments are generally received for providing one or more of the following services to or on behalf of common collective
trust funds or their affiliates: sub-accounting and administrative services (including, among others: order processing, recordkeeping, communications and
shareholder/participant servicing).
H This is the total of the amounts shown in columns E, F, and G and shows the total compensation ADP expects to receive from the investment funds.
I A redemption fee is a fee that some investment funds charge their shareholders when the shareholders redeem their shares. Although a redemption fee is
deducted from redemption proceeds just like a deferred sales load, it is not considered to be a sales load. Unlike a sales load, which is used to pay brokers, a
redemption fee is typically used to defray fund costs associated with a shareholder’s redemption and is paid directly to the fund, not to a broker.
J The total assets in your plan as of the date indicated (minus any loans). Asset information is provided as a convenience only and is not part of the disclosure
required by law. Total assets will change over time. Total assets as of any given date may be found on the Plan Resource Center.
K Your plan’s average weighted expense ratio calculated by weighting the total net expense ratio for each investment fund as shown in column C, based on the
Plan assets in each investment fund (Column B). Only assets in investment funds with a total net expense ratio reported in column C are included in this
calculation. This calculation is being provided to help you evaluate the reasonableness of ADP’s compensation and is not part of the disclosure required by
law. Please contact us if you would like us to provide an updated calculation. If your Plan includes a company stock investment option, assets in that option
are not included in this calculation.
L ADP’s weighted average compensation from investment funds in your plan calculated by weighting the total amount paid to ADP for each investment fund as
shown in column H (including amounts reported as 0.00%), based on the Plan assets in each investment fund (Column B). Only assets in investment funds
with compensation paid to ADP as reported in column H are included in this calculation. If your Plan includes a company stock investment option, assets in
that option are not included in this calculation. This calculation is being provided to help you evaluate the reasonableness of ADP’s compensation and is not
part of the disclosure required by law. Please contact us if you would like us to provide an updated calculation.
In addition to the indirect compensation paid to ADP for services to investment funds, investment fund organizations occasionally compensate ADP or its
employees (generally through the reimbursement or covering of expenses) related to the marketing of investment funds. The amounts involved are occasional
and limited and are minimal in the context of our compensation for services to your Plan.
