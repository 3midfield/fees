This report will help you as plan fiduciaries better understand the costs associated with your retirement plan
- for both you as a plan sponsor and for your plan participants. The report is designed to meet the ERISA fee
disclosure regulations of the United States Department of Labor (DOL).
We have summarized the plan cost components, and have provided a description of the services provided for
those costs. We feel that the more you know about the costs in your plan - including all fees and expenses -
the better you will understand the value of Empower Retirement.
Fee transparency is a sponsor and participant right
Sponsors and participants are entitled to clear information about the fees and expenses associated with their
retirement plans.
Fee transparency is integral to meeting fiduciary responsibilities
We believe that understanding the relationship between cost and benefit is a crucial part of a plan sponsor's
fiduciary responsibilities.
ERISA Requirements
DOL regulations require certain service providers that receive more than $1,000 in compensation to make
explicit disclosures to certain retirement plans that they serve. For more information, please visit the DOL
Employee Benefits Security Administration's website (www.dol.gov/ebsa).
What This Report Contains
This report provides an estimate of the fees paid by your plan.
As your plan's Recordkeeper, we may make payments to other plan service providers on behalf of the plan.
We are not responsible for the disclosures of any unrelated service providers.
This document begins with a high-level summary of the estimated fees and becomes detailed throughout
each section. All the information shown is in dollar figure estimates, where appropriate. To simplify readability,
superscript letters identify dollar figures that carry over from one section and appear in another section as a
line item.
Some of the services and fees described may not be applicable to your plan but are representative of available
services.

IND ID: Page 2 of 18A. Summary of Fee and Expense Estimates
Estimates presented are based on information as of September 30, 2017 on the following:
Total Assets $4,141,055
Unallocated Plan Assets $0
Participant Assets $4,118,344
Loan Balances $22,711
Number of Participants 94
As the fees and expenses contained in this disclosure are estimates based on the above information at a point
in time, they will not necessarily match the actual amounts paid or the amounts contained in any financial
report, such as an Annual Plan Summary.
Total Assets are the sum of Unallocated Assets, Participant Assets and Loan Balances. Plan Unallocated
Assets consist of plan assets that are not allocated to plan participants. This might include unclaimed
participant balances, amounts received but not yet allocated to participants, forfeitures, and amounts set aside
for plan expenses. Participant Assets are amounts held in participants’ accounts. Loan Balances equal
the outstanding loan amounts for participants. Number of Participants includes participants with an account
balance as of the month-end.
In this document, estimates provided may not match amounts billed to the Plan Sponsor or debited from
participant accounts and may not match financial reports. These annual estimates are generally based on
month-end projections that are annualized over a 12-month period and rounded to the nearest dollar.

This document contains estimates of plan expenses and is intended to provide a detailed summary of
fees being charged to the plan or its participants to the extent such information is in the Recordkeeper’s
possession. While it is intended to provide information regarding all material fees, this document may not be
comprehensive, and it may not include full information on fees associated with some specially negotiated
services or with certain investment options, such as Self-Directed Brokerage Accounts, Life Insurance,
Employer Stock, etc. For further fee information, please refer to the relevant service agreements and/or
prospectuses, including information that may be needed to comply with Participant Disclosure obligations.
As your Recordkeeper, we make no representation as to the completeness or accuracy of materials, such as
prospectuses, created and/or provided by a third-party investment provider.
Gain/Loss Disclosure:
If the Recordkeeper makes an error that results in an investment transaction gain or loss, and it is brought
to the Recordkeeper’s attention within ninety (90) days after the Participant statement date following the
occurrence of the error, the Recordkeeper will retroactively correct the error by putting the Participant back
in the financial position where the Participant would have been had the error not occurred. However, if the
Plan or affected Participant knew or should have known of the error but failed to bring it to the Recordkeeper’s
attention within ninety (90) days after the statement date following the occurrence of the error, the error will be
corrected prospectively. If a correction is made at the Recordkeeper’s expense and results in a net loss, the
Recordkeeper will bear the loss. However, if the correction results in an unintended net gain, the Recordkeeper
will retain the gain as compensation for services provided to the plan and to defray reasonable expenses of the
plan including offsetting net losses as described above.
Under special circumstances, the Recordkeeper may consider an exception to the above and make a
correction at the Recordkeeper’s expense. If Plan Sponsor requests such an exception based on the
circumstances identified, a correction will not be unreasonably denied, based on industry standards.
In no event will the Recordkeeper be responsible for the expense of retroactive correction caused by an
error or miscommunication committed by a Participant, Plan Sponsor, or other third party. In such case, Plan
Sponsor will instruct the Recordkeeper how it wishes any resulting gain to be allocated or loss to be funded.
Bank Credit Disclosure:
If the Plan’s assets pass through a bank account held by Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company
(Great-West) or its affiliates/subsidiaries (Great-West Financial Trust Company LLC and EMJAY Corporation),
it may earn credits and/or interest on Plan assets awaiting investment or pending distribution. Any credits or
interest earned by Great-West are aggregated with credits and/or interest earned by Great-West affiliates/
subsidiaries and will be used to defray the aggregate expenses for the maintenance of bank accounts. Great-
West will not retain credits and/or interest earned in excess of such maintenance expenses.
Credits and/or interest are earned from the use of (i) uninvested contributions received too late in the day or
not received in good order to be invested same-day and (ii) proceeds from investment option redemptions
where Plan distribution checks have not been presented for payment by Plan participants. Credits and/or
interest (i) begin to accrue on contributions, on the date such amounts are deposited into the bank account
and end on the date such amounts are invested pursuant to Plan participant or Plan representative instructions
and (ii) begin to accrue on distributions, on the date the check is written or on the wire date, as applicable and
end on the date the check is presented for payment or when the wire clears again the account, as applicable.
Earnings of credits and/or interest are at the rate the bank provides from time to time.
Investments
Mutual Fund Expense Ratio & Collective Investment Trust (CIT) Expense:
DOC_TYPE: FEEDSC_STD 01:071817 401K GP19
DOC ID: 440277905 EV ID:
IND ID: Page 7 of 18The Service Provider has entered into agreements with certain mutual funds/CITs (or their service providers,
including advisors, administrators or transfer agents, and underwriters) whereby the Service Provider provides
shareholder and/or distribution services and receives compensation from the mutual fund/CIT (or their service
providers) based on the value of the plan's investment in the fund/CIT. This compensation may include fees
for administrative and other expenses and/or fees paid under a plan of distribution under SEC Rule 12b-1
("12b-1 fees"). The fees received by the Service Provider are included in the expense ratio described in the
applicable fund’s prospectus or similar disclosure document, and reduce the investment option’s net asset
value (NAV). Generally, fees and expenses included in the expense ratio are deducted at regular intervals
based on a percentage of the investment option’s average daily net assets. For CITs, an investment company
may include other fees that are not disclosed in this fee disclosure document but are provided in a separate
disclosure under separate cover.
Redemption Fees:
Redemption fees are charged by mutual fund companies to discourage investors from making a short-term
“round trip” (i.e. a purchase, typically a transfer, followed by a sale within a short period of time). Most mutual
fund companies that charge redemption fees will impose the fee upon the purchase and subsequent sale
occurring within a specified time frame. Please refer to your mutual fund prospectuses for specific redemption
fee details.
Additional Fund Compensation:
The Service Provider may receive additional revenue as a finder’s fee from non-affiliated fund companies as
shown in the prospectus and other regulatory documents for each of the funds held by the plan. The Service
Provider may also receive additional revenue in the form of conference sponsorship fees from non-affiliated
fund companies to defray training and educational costs of staff.
Rollover Programs:
Great-West may receive payments of up to $25 per rollover under separate agreements with certain rollover
providers (including Millennium Trust Company and WMSI Securities LLC) for providing transaction and
administrative services. Any such payments are not fees for distribution services to the plan under the plan's
administrative services agreement with Great-West.
General Account Fund and Guarantee Provisions:
General Account crediting rates are net of cost of capital and expenses covered by the fund and guarantee
provisions.
Cost of Capital is the return Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company (Great-West) earns on Great-
West capital. Great-West is required by regulators to hold capital for the purpose of ensuring Great-West can
meet all of its obligations associated with the General Account Fund. The amount of Great-West's capital and
required return will fluctuate over time based on regulatory requirements, capital market conditions and the
competitive environment.
The Fund Provision covers the range of investment expenses that are netted from the crediting rate, such as
investment and operating expenses. The Fund Provision is calculated annually in aggregate for all General
Account fixed funds offered by Great-West and does not reflect any product or plan specific underwriting
adjustments.
The Guarantee Provision covers the range of insurance expenses that are netted from the crediting rate, such
as asset defaults, cost of insurance guarantees, and other expenses. The Guarantee Provision is calculated
annually in aggregate for all General Account fixed funds offered by Great-West and does not reflect any
product or plan specific underwriting adjustments. At 12/31/2014, the General Account Guarantee Provision is
0.54%. This expense changes over time as the value of insurance guarantees fluctuate due to both market and
policyholder behaviors. They also vary based on the risk management techniques employed by the insurance
provider. Because of the variances in the cost of the expenses, the level of the insurance guarantees as well

Group Annuity Contract.
5500 Schedule C
As applicable, the disclosures herein are intended to satisfy the eligible indirect compensation (“EIC”)
requirements for Form 5500 Schedule C purposes.
Direct Compensation:
As your Recordkeeper, Empower Retirement tracks and reports all direct fee compensation (such as the
standard fees and non-standard fees that are paid from plan assets during the plan year) as part of the
plan-level reporting in your Annual Plan Summary. A detailed list of direct fees are provided in the Fee and
Withdrawal report as well as summarized in the supplemental report section containing the Information for
Completing Form 5500 Schedule C.
Indirect Compensation:
The listed expenses and costs are the types of eligible indirect compensation that may have been received
either by (i) the Recordkeeper for their services or (ii) mutual fund companies whose funds are investment
options in your Plan. The disclosures herein are intended to satisfy the EIC requirements for Form 5500
Schedule C purposes, as applicable.
Other Investment-Related Fees:
The investment funds offered by your Plan may have fees that are retained by the fund company or other
investment provider as payment for ongoing management of the fund and other services. The fee amounts will
vary from fund to fund and are generally charged as a percentage of the fund’s value.
Please refer to the latest investment materials such as prospectuses and other regulatory disclosures for
each of the funds held by your Plan (as provided by your Plan’s investment advisor or directly from the fund
companies or investment firms) for details regarding services and fees.
The latest prospectus and other regulatory documents for each of the funds held by the plan can be found
within the Investment section of the Plan Service Center.
This list of investment fees is intended to give the plan a list of the most important fees being charged to
the plan or its participants. It is intended to provide information regarding all material fees, but may not be
comprehensive and may not include information on fees such as Self Directed Brokerage Accounts, Life
Insurance, Employer Stock, etc. For other fee information, please refer to all other plan documents including
service agreement and/or prospectus, including information that may be needed to comply with Participant
Disclosure obligations. As your Recordkeeper, we make no representation as to the completeness or accuracy
of materials, such as prospectuses, created and/or provided by a third-party investment provider.
Affiliates and Subcontractors
We are required to disclose certain fees paid between Great-West Life & Annuity Insurance Company (Great-
West) and its related parties (affiliates/subsidiaries and subcontractors). This includes compensation paid in
connection with the services Great-West or its affiliates/subsidiaries have agreed to provide to the plan, if the
compensation is set on a transaction/incentive basis (such as commissions, soft dollars, or finder’s fees) or if
the compensation is charged directly against a plan investment and reflected in the investment’s net value.
